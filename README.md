About This Project
This platform compiles real-time and historical air quality data for Jakarta from four independent API sources. The idea is so that users can explore and download the complete dataset for their own analysis or projects. Beyond station measurements, the platform predicts PM2.5 concentrations for any latitudeâ€“longitude coordinate in Jakarta, providing estimates in areas without direct monitoring coverage.

Technical Overview
Compile and process PM2.5 data from different APIs using Python.
PostgreSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Containerized with Docker and deployed on an Ubuntu server.
Built using Streamlit with integrated UI components and custom assets.
Run machine learning models locally then upload it to the database.
Served through NGINX for performance and reliability.
